      <h2>Some terms to start</h2>
      <p>
        A few terms to begin. The bride is called the <b>Kallah</b>, and the
        groom is called the <b>Chattan</b> (the <i>ch</i> is pronounced like the
        <i>ch</i> in <i>loch</i>). A Jewish wedding takes place under a canopy
        called the <b>Chuppah</b>. The Chuppah is only covered on the top, this
        symbolises a fusion of the home but also of openness.
      </p>
      <h2>The Ceremony</h2>
      <p>
        The day will start with a Tisch, which means “table” in Yiddish/German.
        The bridegroom, family, men, and women, will sing and drink/eat whilst
        the <b>Ketubah</b> is being prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Ketubah</b> is an ancient 2nd Century marriage prenup written in
        Aramaic, the language of the Jewish community of Babylon (c. 500 BC). It
        is a contract of commitment between the man and the woman, and is signed
        confirmed by two witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the contract is signed and everyone is singing, the Tisch-goers
        will go down to the ceremony, and everyone will be seated. The Chattan
        walks in with his parents and waits for his Kallah under the Chuppah.
      </p>
      <p>
        He will need to confirm the bride is who he thinks she is. This is
        because of the story of Jacob in the Bible. Jacob got tricked by a
        scheming father-in-law to marry Leah instead of his preferred choice
        Rachel. This process is called the <b>Bedecken</b>, The Chattan will
        confirm it is his wife to be and lower her veil.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rabbi will introduce the couple and start the marriage process. The
        Ketubah will be read out, and will be followed by a series of seven
        blessings over a cup of wine read out by male relatives and close
        friends. The wine is then drunk by the Kallah and the Chattan, there is
        the potential for major wedding dress ruining here, which explains the
        choice of white over red wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the Chattan will utter the following line whilst giving the Kallah
        a ring, “With this item I make you holy you to me”. After that a glass
        will be broken and all hell breaks loose. The glass is broken to
        symbolise the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, which
        occurred in 72CE, around 40 years after Jesus. According to Jewish
        tradition, the Jewish people is in a state of exile until the Temple is
        rebuilt.
      </p>
      <h2>The Party</h2>
      <p>
        After the Chuppah, the couple are whisked away to a room for time to
        recover. Meanwhile, there’s a reception, followed by the party. Jewish
        weddings have a lot of dancing, so bring comfortable shoes! Below is a
        playlist with some of the songs to get you in the mood, it's going to be
        fun!
      </p>
      <p>We can't wait to celebrate with you!</p>
