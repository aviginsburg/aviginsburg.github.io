        Hey friend! Soon you will be dancing with us at maybe your first Jewish
        wedding. Good luck, it is going to be pretty heavy. A lot of stuff is
        going to happen, so this will be your guide to the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Jewish wedding, like many other religious weddings, is a day of the
        union of two people. Much will look familiar from a traditional
        Christian ceremony, but there are a number of key differences. Another
        thing to note is that Jewish tradition is reasonably patriarchal, so a
        number of things throughout the day will seem a tad dated. These have
        been modernised slightly, but this isn’t an apology.
      </p>
      <h2>Some terms to start!</h2>
      <p>
        A few terms to begin. The bride is called the <b>Kalah</b>, and the
        groom is called the <b>Chattan</b>. Also, the wedding takes place under
        an awning called the <b>Chuppah</b>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Ceremony</h2>
      <p>
        A Jewish wedding is a mixture of Halacha and Minhag. The day will start
        with a Tisch, which means table in Yiddish, but is when the men (and
        some women depending on the ceremony), will sing and drink/eat whilst
        the <b>Ketubah</b> is being prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Ketubah</b> is an ancient 2nd Century marriage prenup. It is a
        list of things the Chattan is required to provide for his wife, with a
        failure to meet these being grounds for divorce. These include shelter,
        food, and good sex. Fun right? The Ketubah is written in Aramaic, a
        language spoken by a few Iraqi tribes in Northern Iraq and the language
        of the Jewish community of Babylon (c. 500 BC), and is signed by two
        male witnesses (we will come back to it later).
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the contract is signed and everyone is singing (there is a whole
        section on signing), the Tisch-goers will go down to the ceremony, and
        everyone will be seated. The Chattan will need to confirm the bride is
        who he thinks she is. this is because of the story of Jacob in the
        Bible. Jacob got tricked by a scheming father-in-law to marry Leah
        instead of his preferred choice Rebecca. Luckily for me, Yael’s sister
        is married but it is always good to be certain
        <i>#longlivethepatricarchy</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process is called the <b>Bedeken</b>, The Chattan will lift up the
        veil of the Kalah, confirm it is her and then put it down again. The
        <b>Bedeken</b> can occur in a number of different places, but for this
        wedding it will occur when the Kalah walks down to the Chuppah.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rabbi (there’s no definition for Rabbi, you should know what this
        is), will introduce the couple and start the marriage process. The
        Ketubah will be read out, enjoy (very long and not massively
        interesting). There will be a series of seven blessings over a cup of
        wine read out by male relatives and close friends #yep. The wine is then
        drunk by the Kalah and the Chattan, there is the potential for major
        wedding dress ruining here, so this is done extremely carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the couple will utter the following line whilst giving the utter
        party a ring, “With this item I consecrate you to me”. After that a
        glass will be broken and all hell breaks loose. The glass is broken to
        symbolise the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, which
        occurred in 72CE, around 40 years after Jesus was killed. Jews are not
        complete until the Temple is rebuilt.
      </p>
      <h2>The Party</h2>
      <p>
        After the Chuppah, the couple are whisked away to a room for *cough*
        time to recover. During this time, the room is guarded by the two
        witnesses who signed the Ketubah.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the reception, the dancing starts. Jewish weddings have a lot of
        dancing! Our party will be divided into three sections; separate
        dancing, mixed <b>Horah</b> dancing. and then party music.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a playlist with some of the songs you can expect.</p>
      <p>We can't wait to see you!</p>
